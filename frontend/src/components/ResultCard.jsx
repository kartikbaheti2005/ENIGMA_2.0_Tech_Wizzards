The good news is that BCC rarely spreads to other parts of the body, and it is very treatable. However, left untreated it can cause significant damage to the skin and surrounding tissue. You need to see a dermatologist soon. This is not something to monitor at home or put off for later — a quick professional evaluation can resolve this before it becomes a bigger problem.`,

It is not yet cancer, but it is a direct precursor that can progress to Squamous Cell Carcinoma in some cases. Think of this as your body giving you an early warning. Treatment at this stage is simple, quick, and highly effective. Please consult a dermatologist soon — catching this now is far better than dealing with it later.`,

Most of the time this is nothing to worry about. That said, the visual patterns picked up by the AI could also overlap with other conditions, including early-stage skin changes. We'd recommend getting a dermatologist to take a quick look — just to confirm it's benign and give you peace of mind. It could also simply be a fungal infection or a skin reaction to an allergen.`,

However, since skin conditions can sometimes resemble each other, it is always a good idea to have a dermatologist confirm this in person. It could also be a minor allergic reaction or a small skin infection. No need to panic — just get it checked at your next convenient opportunity.`,

The vast majority of vascular lesions are completely harmless. However, some rarer types do warrant monitoring.
